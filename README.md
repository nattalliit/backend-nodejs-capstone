5. Implement Search service API
6. Implement Sentiment Analysis service API
7. Implement Registration backend service API
8. Implement Login backend service API
9. Implement User Profile backend service API
10. Integrate the frontend provided with the backend
11. Add CI/CD pipelines for backend services
12. Containerize the services and applications
13. Deploy backend services

## User Stories
User stories are a fundamental component in Agile methodologies, serving as a simple yet powerful tool for understanding user requirements. They are typically written from a user's perspective and focus on what they need from the system to achieve a specific goal. A well-crafted user story is concise and focuses on a single functionality or feature, helping to break down complex projects into manageable work units.

Create thirteen user stories in your GitHub repository, one for each of the above steps of your project.
